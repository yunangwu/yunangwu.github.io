In a bustling city, amidst towering skyscrapers, lived a forgotten clockmaker named Ezra. His tiny shop, tucked away in an alley, held secrets of intricate timepieces crafted with precision and love. Each tick echoed memories of forgotten moments, each tock whispered dreams of lost souls. Yet, despite the cacophony of life outside, Ezra found solace in the symphony of gears and springs. One stormy night, a stranger stumbled upon his shop, seeking shelter from the tempest. With a warm smile, Ezra invited the weary traveler in, offering tea and tales of time woven into the fabric of their souls.
